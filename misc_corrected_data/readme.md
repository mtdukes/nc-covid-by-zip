# WRAL COVID-19 dashboard changelog

[WRAL's dashboard of COVID-19 statistics and charts](https://www.wral.com/coronavirus/north-carolina-coronavirus-cases-maps-graphs-live-updates/19010016/) has evolved since its initial launch in the early stage of the pandemic. We'll track changes to our metrics and tracking methodology, and note any corrections to our data here starting on Sept. 5.

## Sept. 5, 2020 - Correction

During the week of Aug. 30, the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services made corrections to its reported case counts for several days in August after LabCorp reported a delay of nearly 1,000 positive test results.

DHHS posted the following explanation on its data dashboard Sept. 3:

> On August 29, 2020, LabCorp submitted approximately 1,163 positive
> tests results for which the majority were completed during the first
> of half of August 2020. Because one person may have multiple tests,
> these tests represent 886 unique cases. This submission caused an
> artificially high number of cases reported for August 29. These 886
> cases have now been distributed to the dates in August when they would
> have been reported to the state.

And in response to follow-up questions on Sept. 4, DHHS spokesperson SarahLewis Peel wrote via email: 

> In updating the NC COVID-19 county-level cases data impacted by the
> LabCorp data delays, cases were distributed to the dates in August
> when they would have been reported to the state. However, the delayed
> data on 8/29 that had been received were not subtracted from that
> dayâ€™s date.

> On 9/4 at 4:35 p.m. NCDHHS updated all state and county-level cases

Using time-series data of reported cases [published by DHHS](https://public.tableau.com/views/NCDHHS_COVID-19_DataDownload/DailyMetrics?:showVizHome=no), WRAL corrected its own numbers at about 3 p.m., Sept. 5, for the period from Aug. 1 to Sept. 5. The changes ultimately redistributed 886 positive cases across 23 days in August 2020.

This correction impacted the following metrics and trend lines on WRAL's data dashboard:

 - Reported new cases
 - 7-day rolling average of reported new cases
 - 7-day rolling average of tests reported positive
